Topic: Diversity and Inclusion
The three articles I selected focus on different communities, including race, gender, and accessibility. They highlight groups like the elderly, international students, and non-binary or feminist individuals.

Design Choice
- I wanted to create an inviting website that uses color to represent different communities. The phrase "we all belong here" is central to my design because, regardless of race, gender, or background, we all share the same humanity. I believe that diversity fosters greater creativity. I kept the background white for readability and to make the colors stand out.

Features 
- Added colorful visual elements around the title representing different background & communities.
- Created a flower-like shape by using border line and rotationon css.
- Added a slow, infinite up-and-down scroll effect to encourage users to keep scrolling.
- Implemented a transformation effect that changes color and moves items 10px upward when hovered or tapped on article at the landing page.
  
Article Page
- Each article is color-coded to define each page. 
- Shapes in the background are styled using z-index and absolute positioning to keep them behind text and make it cohesive between landing page and article page.
- I used px for shape location, but I plan to transition to percentage-based sizing when I have more time. Also, I used calc for shape when changed to desktop but I'd like to use them for spacing when I have more time. 

Goal
- Complete the basic website structure, including a landing page and links between the three articles, with proper margin and padding, then adding styling and animation to enhance the user experience later. 

Challenges
- I initially struggled to link articles correctly. While the links worked locally, they didn’t function properly when uploaded to GitHub. I resolved this by rearranging and renaming files with the correct paths with the help of my professors and tutor.
- Centering elements and adjusting margin/padding was still tricky. 
- I spent 80% of my time debugging and only 20% creating. I’ve learned to be cautious when adding new elements, as they often introduce new issues.

Lessons Learned
- Prioritize completing the basics first.
- Schedule regular coding sessions with a tutor to address challenges, even when I don’t have immediate questions.

Next Steps
- Use variables and root properties more effectively.
- Finalize design elements like font sizes and colors earlier to avoid hesitation later.
- Add a parallax effect to the background shapes.
- Remove extra spacing below on hover effects landing page. 
- Explore new features like filters, hyphens, and WebKit tools to improve text formatting.
